# How to Fix Your Production Issue

## Problem
Your production site is trying to call APIs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` instead of `https://smashburgertz.com` because the frontend JavaScript was compiled with the wrong API URL.

## Solution
Since npm is not available on your Hostinger server, you need to build the assets **locally** and then upload them to your server.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Run the build script**:
   - Double-click the `build-for-production.bat` file in your project folder
   - OR open Command Prompt in your project folder and run:
     ```cmd
     build-for-production.bat
     ```

2. **Wait for the build to complete**
   - This will temporarily change your local .env to production settings
   - Build the assets with the correct API URL
   - Restore your local .env automatically

3. **Upload the following files to Hostinger**:
   - `public/js/app.js`
   - `public/css/app.css`
   - `public/mix-manifest.json`

### Option 2: Manual Steps

If you prefer to do it manually:

1. **Temporarily update your local `.env` file**:
   ```
   Change this line:
   APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
   
   To:
   APP_URL=https://smashburgertz.com
   ```

2. **Build the production assets**:
   ```cmd
   npm run production
   ```

3. **Restore your local `.env` file**:
   ```
   Change back to:
   APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

4. **Upload these files to your Hostinger server**:
   - `public/js/app.js` (this is the main file that needs updating)
   - `public/css/app.css`
   - `public/mix-manifest.json`

## Additional Server-Side Fixes

After uploading the compiled assets, also make sure on your **Hostinger server**:

1. **Update the server's `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   APP_URL=https://smashburgertz.com
   ```

2. **Clear Laravel caches**:
   ```bash
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

3. **Ensure storage link exists**:
   ```bash
   php artisan storage:link
   ```

✅ The favicon error will be resolved

## Verification

After completing these steps:

1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Visit your site: https://smashburgertz.com
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab
4. Refresh the page
5. You should see API calls going to `https://smashburgertz.com/api/...` instead of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/...`
