                    URGENT: UPLOAD THESE FILES TO HOSTINGER
================================================================================

Your local files have been successfully compiled with the production URL
(https://smashburgertz.com), but you need to upload them to your server!

FILES TO UPLOAD TO HOSTINGER:
------------------------------

1. public/js/app.js                    ← MOST IMPORTANT!
2. public/css/app.css
3. public/mix-manifest.json
4. public/serviceworker.js              ← Fixed service worker error
5. public/storage/31/fav-icon.png       ← Fixed favicon error

HOW TO UPLOAD:
--------------
Using FileZilla, cPanel File Manager, or your hosting control panel:

1. Go to your website's root directory (usually public_html/)
2. Navigate to: public/js/
3. Replace the existing app.js with your new local app.js
4. Navigate to: public/css/
5. Replace the existing app.css with your new local app.css
6. Navigate to: public/
7. Replace the existing mix-manifest.json with your new local mix-manifest.json
8. Replace the existing serviceworker.js with your new local serviceworker.js
9. Navigate to: public/storage/31/
10. Upload the fav-icon.png file

AFTER UPLOADING:
----------------
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Hard refresh your website (Ctrl + F5)
3. Check browser console - API calls should now go to https://smashburgertz.com

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- The files are already compiled with the correct production URL
- You just need to upload them to replace the old files
- Make sure your server's .env file has: APP_URL=https://smashburgertz.com
- The issue is NOT with npm on the server - it's just that you need to upload
  the compiled files
