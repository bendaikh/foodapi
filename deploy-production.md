# Production Deployment Instructions

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Service worker Response conversion error
2. ✅ Missing favicon file (created fav-icon.png)
3. ✅ Identified API URL configuration issue

## Required Changes for Production:

### 1. Update Environment Variables
You need to update your `.env` file on your Hostinger server with these changes:

```bash
# Change from:
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

# To:
APP_URL=https://smashburgertz.com
```

### 2. Rebuild Frontend Assets
After updating the environment variables, you need to rebuild the frontend assets:

```bash
# On your Hostinger server, run:
npm run production
```

This will compile the JavaScript with the correct API URL.

### 3. Clear Laravel Caches
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

### 4. Ensure Storage Link is Created
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### 5. Set Proper File Permissions
```bash
chmod -R 755 storage/
chmod -R 755 public/storage/
```

## Files Modified:
- `public/serviceworker.js` - Fixed offline page path
- `public/storage/31/fav-icon.png` - Created missing favicon file

## Next Steps:
1. Upload the modified files to your server
2. Update your `.env` file on the server
3. Run the commands above on your server
4. Test your website

The main issue was that your frontend was trying to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` instead of `https://smashburgertz.com`. Once you update the environment variables and rebuild the assets, all API calls should work correctly.
